THIS SOFTWARE IS LICENSED, NOT SOLD. YOU MAY USE THIS SOFTWARE ONLY AS DESCRIBED IN THIS AGREEMENT.

1. SOFTWARE. The capitalized term "Software" refers to the object code for the computer program known as CuteFTP 8 Professional, any updates, supplemental code or programs provided to you by GlobalSCAPE with or in connection with CuteFTP 8 Professional, the user's manual and Help file, any components, any related media and printed materials, and any related "online" or electronic documentation.

2. GRANT OF LICENSE. Evaluation License. If you acquired the license for the Software on an evaluation or trial basis, you may use the Software without charge for the evaluation period. Your evaluation period begins on the day you install the Software. You must pay the license fee and register your copy to continue to use the Software after the evaluation period. To pay the license fee and register your copy, you should visit www.globalscape.com or an authorized sales agent. For so long as the Software is the most current version of CuteFTP Professional distributed by GlobalSCAPE, you may give exact copies of the evaluation Software to anyone. You may not charge any fee for the copy or use of the evaluation Software itself, but you may charge a distribution fee that is reasonably related to any cost you incur distributing the evaluation Software (e.g. packaging). You must not represent in any way that you are selling the Software itself. Your distribution of the evaluation Software will not entitle you to any compensation from GlobalSCAPE. You must distribute a copy of this license with any copy of the Software and anyone to whom you distribute the Software is subject to this license. You may not remove any copyright, trademark or reservation of rights language displayed on, in or with the Software.

Registered License. When you purchase a license, you will be provided with a registration number. You must enable the registered license for the Software by entering the registration number as prompted by the Software. The term of the license is perpetual unless you purchased a limited term license. You may install and use one copy of the registered Software on the number of computers for which you have purchased a separate license as indicated on the invoice or sales receipt. If the Software is installed on a network server or other storage device, you must purchase a license for each separate computer on which the Software is used or accessed. A license for the Software may not be shared by alternating use of the Software between different computers. If you acquired the Software for a reduced price as an upgrade from a previous version of the Software, you may no longer use the previous version. The primary user of a computer for which a license has been purchased may access the Software via a remote technology, and may make and use one copy of the Software on his or her portable computer. You may also make one copy of the Software for back-up or archival purposes. Otherwise, you may not copy the Software in whole or in part. You may permanently transfer all of your rights under this license if the recipient agrees to the terms of this license, you destroy any copy of the Software not transferred to the recipient, and, if the Software was licensed to you at a reduced price as an upgrade from a previous version, you destroy any copy of any previous version that is not transferred to the recipient. If you purchased the Software on a multi-user basis, you may permanently transfer your rights to one person only, but that person may use the Software on that number of computers for which you purchased a license.

GlobalSCAPE may use any information you provide as part of obtaining support services for its business purposes, including product support and development.

5.  INFORMATION COLLECTION. The Software includes a feature that assigns a unique number to your computer based on system information. The Software reports this number to us either when you install the Software or enter your registration number, or both.

We use this information to count the number of installations, detect piracy of the Software, and develop rough statistical data regarding the geographic location of our users. If you register our Software, we tie this information to the personally identifiable information that we have about you.

6. TERMINATION.  This license terminates if you fail to comply with its terms and conditions.  If your license terminates, you must destroy all copies of the Software. The termination of this license does not limit GlobalSCAPE's other rights it may have by law.

7. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. You acknowledge that you have only the limited, non-exclusive right to use and copy the Software as expressly stated in this license and that GlobalSCAPE retains title to the Software and all other rights not expressly granted.
